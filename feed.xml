<p>Chess is a game of skill.  No matter how many times I am in a room with Magnus Carlson, I will lose.  If someone was offering you 1000:1 odds on my victory in a single game, you should still bet on Magnus.</p>

<p>Poker is a game skill <em>AND</em> luck.  Placed heads-up against a top rated player in poker, there is a chance, greater than zero, that the cards fall the right way for an amateur challenger.  Someone who has never seen a game of poker in their life can go all-in, get called, and reveal pocket aces.  Chess this ain’t.</p>

<p>So, here’s an interesting question: precisely how much of poker is luck?  Is there a good way to get a sense of it?  If an amateur played a pro, how much of a chance would they stand?  Let’s see what we can find out…</p>

<h2> The Worst Poker Player You Know - Strategy Overview </h2>

<p>What might you do if you were faced with a pro?  Presumably you want to minimise their advantage, while minimising the number of important strategic decisions you have to take (and presumably, mess up).  More decisions equals more wrong decisions.</p>

<p>Therefore, I propose the most annoying strategy one can dream up: goinh all-in every time.  Conveniently, since we want to do some analysis on this in a bit, it also helps a great deal with the math.</p>

<p>How does this strategy do against a pro making all the optimal decisions?  A quick search on the internet produces a trove of incorrect answers and I consider it my public duty to help clear this mess up a litte.  Let’s approach this from the point-of-view of the pro and get some quick bounds on a solution.</p>

<h3>Upper and Lower Bounds<h3>
To get an lower bound on the pro's win rate, all we have to do is propose any strategy, find its win rate and claim that.  The simplest possible strategy is to do exactly the same thing - call every time.  This is obviously a suboptimal strategy, but it's easy to see that this game is symmetric, and the win rate for the pro is 50%.

For an upper bound, we can also make a fairly straightforward estimate.  To do this, we imagine giving our pro a massive unfair advantage and seeing how they do.  For instance, consider the case where our pro is the luckiest player in the world - they get pocket aces on every hand.  Clearly, the only move here is to go all-in, just as before.  The win rate for the pro in this case is equal to the win rate of pocket aces against a random hand.  The magic number here is 84.93%.  Nice.

In summary, our optimal pro has a win rate, $w*$ that satisfies:

\$\$
0.50 &lt;= w* &lt;= 0.85
\$\$

Can we tighten the bounds on this solution?  Yes, but we're going to need a bit of a run-up...

<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
