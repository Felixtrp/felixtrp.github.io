<h3> Luck and Skill </h3>

Chess is a game of skill.  No matter how many times I am in a room with Magnus Carlson, I will lose.  If someone was offering you 1000:1 odds on my victory in a single game, you should still bet on Magnus.

Poker is a game skill *AND* luck.  Placed heads-up against a top rated player in poker, there is a chance, greater than zero, that the cards fall the right way for an amateur challenger.  Someone who has never seen a game of poker in their life can go all-in, get called, and reveal pocket aces.  Chess this ain't.
